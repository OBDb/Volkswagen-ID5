    description: "The Volkswagen ID.5 represents the brand's first electric SUV coupé, essentially a sleeker, more style-focused variant of the ID.4 built on the same dedicated MEB (Modular Electric Drive Matrix) platform. Featuring identical dimensions to the ID.4 from the front to the B-pillar but with a distinctive coupé-like roofline that slopes more dramatically toward the rear, the ID.5 prioritizes design and aerodynamics while maintaining much of the practicality of its conventional SUV sibling. The more aerodynamic profile contributes to a slightly improved drag coefficient of 0.26 (compared to the ID.4's 0.28), enhancing efficiency and range. Offered exclusively with the larger 77 kWh (net) battery pack, the ID.5 is available in three powertrain configurations: the rear-wheel drive Pro with a single motor producing 174 horsepower, the rear-wheel drive Pro Performance with an enhanced single motor delivering 201 horsepower, and the dual-motor all-wheel drive GTX variant combining front and rear motors for a total of 295-299 horsepower (depending on market). Range varies by configuration but typically exceeds the equivalent ID.4 variants slightly, with WLTP ratings of approximately 313-323 miles for rear-wheel drive models and up to 298 miles for the GTX. Charging capabilities include DC fast charging at up to 135 kW, enabling a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior is virtually identical to the ID.4, featuring a minimalist design with a standard 12-inch touchscreen infotainment system, compact digital instrument display, and ambient lighting with customizable color options. Despite the coupé roofline, rear headroom is reduced by only 12mm compared to the ID.4, while luggage capacity remains generous at 549 liters (expanding to 1,561 liters with rear seats folded). Advanced technology includes enhanced driver assistance systems with Travel Assist for partially automated driving, LED matrix headlights, and augmented reality head-up display on higher trim levels. The ID.5 represents Volkswagen's response to the growing demand for more distinctively styled electric vehicles, offering a more design-focused alternative to the conventional ID.4 SUV while maintaining most of its practical advantages and targeting buyers willing to pay a premium for more expressive styling."
